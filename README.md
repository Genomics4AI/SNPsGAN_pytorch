The majority of studies in population genetics make use of data consisting of single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs); however, in many circumstances, the number of the needed data samples (i.e.,individuals) are not sufficient enough to train a supervised deep learning model and that is mainly duea large number of features present in the data â€“compared to the number of samples (widely known asthe curse of dimensionality). Moreover, the issue of privacy restricts the public distribution of the real datasamples which prevents sharing of them across different projects and groups to accelerate research andenhance outcomes and predictions. In this study by leveraging deep generative models, namely conditionalgenerative adversarial networks (cGANS) and conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs) we attempt todeal with such scarcity and privacy through synthesizing data samples of SNPs with particular attributesof interest.
