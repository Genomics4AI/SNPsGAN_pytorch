The majority of studies in population genetics make use of data consisting of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); however, in many circumstances, the number of the needed data samples (i.e.,individuals) are not sufficient enough to train a supervised deep learning model and that is mainly due to a large number of features present in the data â€“compared to the number of samples (widely known as the curse of dimensionality). Moreover, the issue of privacy restricts the public distribution of the real datasamples which prevents sharing of them across different projects and groups to accelerate research and enhance outcomes and predictions. In this study, by leveraging deep generative models, namely conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANS) and conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs) we attempt to deal with such scarcity and privacy through synthesizing data samples of SNPs with particular attributes of interest.
